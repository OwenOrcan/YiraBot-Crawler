# YiraBot README

## Introduction
YiraBot is a versatile Python package designed for crawling, scraping, and analyzing web pages. It provides a range of functionalities from basic webpage crawling to detailed SEO analysis, mobile responsiveness checks, and social media integration verification. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to using YiraBot, including installation, usage examples, and an explanation of its core features.

## Installation

Before you can use YiraBot, you need to ensure Python is installed on your system. YiraBot is compatible with Python 3.6 and above. You can install YiraBot using pip:

```bash
pip install yirabot
```

## Features

YiraBot offers a range of functionalities, including:

- **Web Crawling and Scraping**: Crawls web pages to extract metadata, links, images, and specific content.
- **SEO Analysis**: Performs SEO checks on web pages, including title, meta descriptions, headings, and keyword analysis.
- **Mobile Responsiveness Check**: Verifies if a web page is mobile responsive.
- **Social Media Integration Check**: Checks for the presence of social media platform integration on a web page.
- **Protected Page Crawling**: Supports crawling of pages that require authentication.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

YiraBot can be invoked directly from the command line with various commands and options:

```bash
yirabot <command> [options]
```

#### Commands

- `crawl`: Crawls a given URL to extract data.
- `scrape`: Specifically extracts main content from a URL.
- `seo`: Performs an SEO analysis of the specified web page.
- `get-html`: Downloads and saves the complete HTML content of a web page.

#### Options

- `-mobile`: Uses a mobile user agent for requests.
- `-file`: Saves the extracted data in text format.
- `-json`: Saves the extracted data in JSON format.

### Examples

**Crawling a Web Page**

To crawl a web page and display extracted data:

```bash
yirabot crawl example.com
```

**Saving Crawled Data**

To crawl a web page and save the extracted data in JSON format:

```bash
yirabot crawl example.com -json
```

**Performing SEO Analysis**

To perform an SEO analysis on a web page:

```bash
yirabot seo example.com
```

**Checking Mobile Responsiveness**

Mobile responsiveness is part of the SEO analysis. To check if a page is mobile responsive:

```bash
yirabot seo example.com
```

Look for the "Mobile Responsiveness" section in the output.

**Crawling Protected Pages**

YiraBot also supports crawling pages that require authentication. This process is more involved and requires setting up a session:

```bash
yirabot session
```

Follow the interactive prompts to enter login details and choose the crawling method.

## Understanding Command Flags and Their Impact

When using YiraBot from the command line, you can modify its behavior with various flags. These flags allow you to tailor the crawling and analysis process to your specific needs. Hereâ€™s how the functionality changes with different flags:

- **-mobile**: Simulates a mobile user agent, which is essential for testing mobile responsiveness and seeing how a site presents itself on mobile devices.
- **-file**: Saves the extracted data in a text file. This is useful for documentation purposes or further analysis.
- **-json**: Saves the extracted data in a JSON file, offering a structured format that's easy to integrate with other tools and systems.

Each flag is designed to offer flexibility and control over the crawling and analysis process, ensuring that you can obtain the data you need in the format that best suits your project.

YiraBot is a powerful tool for developers, SEO specialists, and anyone interested in web page analysis. By following this guide, you should be able to install YiraBot, understand its capabilities, and start using it for your web crawling and analysis needs.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. SEO Analysis (`seo_analysis`)

- **Description**: Performs an in-depth SEO analysis on a given URL.
- **Key Features**:
  - Analyzes various SEO factors such as title length, meta description length, headings usage, images without alt text, keyword analysis, mobile responsiveness, social media integration, and website language.
  - Utilizes a user-agent from `get_random_user_agent()` for requests, simulating different browser types for more accurate SEO testing.

### 2. Crawling (`crawl`)

- **Description**: Crawls a given URL to collect comprehensive data about the page.
- **Key Features**:
  - Extracts information such as favicon, meta description, title, Open Graph tags, Twitter card tags, canonical URL, internal and external links, and image URLs.
  - Optionally bypasses robots.txt restrictions with the `force` parameter.
  - Includes a `dynamic_delay` mechanism to adjust request timing based on the server's response, simulating more natural browsing behavior.

### 3. Scraping (`scrape`)

- **Description**: Targets the main content of a webpage, extracting paragraphs, headings, and lists.
- **Key Features**:
  - Designed to scrape content while optionally ignoring robots.txt restrictions through the `force` parameter.
  - Focuses on extracting textual content critical for content analysis or SEO purposes.

### 4. Sitemap Validation (`validate`)

- **Description**: Validates URLs found in a specified sitemap.
- **Key Features**:
  - Parses the sitemap URL to extract all contained URLs, then checks each URL for accessibility, capturing their HTTP response status.
  - Useful for ensuring that all URLs in a sitemap are accessible and do not lead to errors.

## Advanced Features

- **Session Management**: Supports the use of sessions via the requests library for more efficient HTTP requests by reusing TCP connections.
- **User-Agent Randomization**: Mimics different browsers by setting a random user-agent for each request, improving the likelihood of obtaining accurate website content as seen by users.
- **Dynamic Request Delay**: Implements a `dynamic_delay` function to adjust the frequency of requests dynamically, reducing the risk of being blocked by the target server.
- **Robots.txt Respect**: By default, respects robots.txt policies for crawling and scraping, unless overridden, ensuring ethical web scraping practices.
- **Recursive Error Handling**: For methods like crawl and scrape, there's a mechanism to retry the operation in certain failure scenarios, aiming to improve data retrieval success rates.

## Usage Scenarios

- **SEO Audits**: Yirabot can be used to conduct SEO audits on web pages, analyzing critical factors that influence search engine rankings.
- **Content Extraction**: Ideal for extracting specific content from web pages, such as text, images, and links, for analysis or repurposing.
- **Website Health Checks**: Validates sitemaps and checks the accessibility of URLs, which is crucial for website maintenance and SEO.

## Implementation Notes

To use Yirabot, instantiate the class and call the desired method with appropriate parameters. For SEO analysis and content scraping, pass the target URL and, if available, a session object for authenticated requests.

When performing actions that might be restricted by robots.txt, consider the ethical implications and the legality of bypassing such restrictions with the `force` parameter.

This class serves as a versatile tool for developers, SEO specialists, and content managers looking to automate the process of web data extraction and analysis, enhancing SEO strategies and website maintenance practices.

# Examples Using YiraBot Class
## SEO Analysis
```python
from yirabot import Yirabot

bot = Yirabot()
url = "https://example.com"
seo_data = bot.seo_analysis(url)

# Example of processing SEO data
print("Title Length:", seo_data['title_length'])
print("Meta Description Length:", seo_data['meta_desc_length'])
print("Responsive:", "Yes" if seo_data['is_responsive'] else "No")
```
## Crawling
```python
url = "https://example.com"
crawl_data = bot.crawl(url, force=True) #Only use force in ethical situations

# Displaying some extracted data
print("Page Title:", crawl_data['title'])
print("Number of Internal Links:", len(crawl_data['internal_links']))
print("Number of External Links:", len(crawl_data['external_links']))
```
## Scraping
```python
url = "https://example.com/blog"
content_data = bot.scrape(url)

# Displaying the first paragraph and heading
print("First Paragraph:", content_data['paragraphs'][0])
print("First Heading:", content_data['headings'][0])
```
## Sitemap Validation
```python
sitemap_url = "https://example.com/sitemap.xml"
validation_results = bot.validate(sitemap_url)

# Checking and printing inaccessible URLs
inaccessible_urls = {url: status for url, status in validation_results.items() if status != 200}
print("Inaccessible URLs:", inaccessible_urls)
```
